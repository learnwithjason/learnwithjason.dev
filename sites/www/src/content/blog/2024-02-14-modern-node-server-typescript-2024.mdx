I've had to look up how to create a new Node server enough times that I'm writing it down to make it easier for me to find in the future. This is a quick and dirty post without much context or explanation. Feel free to [ask me for details](https://lwj.dev/discord) if something I said isn't clear.

This is the fastest way I know of to get a Node server running with TypeScript as of 2024. If you know a better way, please do let me know!

<Aside>
  **Heads up!** Make sure you're using Node >=20.6 — it's required for some of the flags used in this setup.

## Set up the project

```sh
# create a new project
mkdir my-node-app
cd my-node-app/

# initialize the project
git init
npm init -y

# install dev dependencies
npm i -D typescript ts-node @types/node

# initialize TypeScript
npx tsc --init
```

Next, open `package.json` and add the following:

```json title="package.json" mark={2-4,10-11}
{
	"engines": {
		"node": ">=20.6.0"
	},
	"name": "my-node-app",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		"build": "tsc",
		"dev": "node --env-file=.env --watch -r ts-node/register src/index.ts",
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	},
	"author": "Jason Lengstorf <jason@learnwithjason.dev>",
	"license": "ISC",
	"devDependencies": {
		"@types/node": "^20.11.17",
		"ts-node": "^10.9.2",
		"typescript": "^5.3.3"
	}
}
```

<Aside>
  **Heads up!** The [`--watch` flag](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cli.html#--watch) was added in Node v18.11.0. The [`--env-file=config` flag](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cli.html#--env-fileconfig) was added in Node v20.6.0.

## Add environment variables, if needed

Create `.env` and put any secrets inside:

```sh title=".env"
TEST_VALUE=hello
```

## Create the main Node app file

Create `src/index.ts` and put something inside:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
function test(): void {
	console.log(process.env.TEST_VALUE);
}

test();
```

## Start the Node server and test live reload

Start the server with `npm run dev` and you'll see the following output:

```sh
❯ npm run dev

> my-node-app@1.0.0 dev
> node --env-file=.env --watch -r ts-node/register src/index.ts

(node:29702) ExperimentalWarning: Watch mode is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
hello
Completed running 'src/index.ts'
```

Make a change to `src/index.ts` or `.env` and the server will automatically restart and show your changes in the console.

And that's it — now you've got a Node app with TypeScript running with live reloading and environment variables, using as few dependencies as possible, modernized for building apps in 2024.

Happy building!
