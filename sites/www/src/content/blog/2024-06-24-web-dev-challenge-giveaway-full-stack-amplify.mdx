## You have the chance to win a dream desk setup!

In every episode of [_Web Dev Challenge_](https://lwj.dev/wdc), developers from around the community challenge themselves to build an app that meets a prompt and uses a given tool.

Now you can be one of those devs! **Build your own take on the app prompt and submit it to the showcase** to learn something new, show off your work, have some fun with the web dev community, and learn (or practice) practical skills.

And, as a bonus, **one dev will win a dream desk setup**: [Ugmonk's complete Gather collection](https://ugmonk.com/collections/the-gather-collection/products/the-complete-gather-collection-black-maple?variant=42601772220566).

  **Please note:** while anyone can participate, only US residents are eligible to win the desk setup at this time. We're exploring the legal requirements of opening up the giveaway to more countries in future giveaways, but this stuff is _complicated_. Thanks for your understanding.

## The prompt: “build a retro games-themed web app using AWS Amplify”

For this episode, the devs are building a web app for any kind of retro gaming theme they can think of. A Dr. Mario tournament app? Pong leaderboard? Investment advice for Monopoly players? It's all fair game!

Amazon Web Services is sponsoring this episode and giveaway, and the apps must be built using [AWS Amplify](https://lwj.dev/amplify), which can be used for the frontend deployment and/or for the backend of your web app.

## Make new connections and get expert guidance

We've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) called `#builder-chat` for brainstorming, sharing ideas, and keeping each other accountable.

We've also got our friends from the AWS Amplify team available to provide technical guidance as you're building.

## The rules and how to submit

If you want to play along, here’s how:

1. Build a web app that has a retro games theme
2. Spend 30 minutes planning your app¹
3. Spend 4 hours building your app¹
4. Use [AWS Amplify](https://lwj.dev/amplify) as part of your web app
5. Release the source code as a public GitHub repo
6. Publish the web app to a public URL
7. Submit your web app by 11:59 pm Pacific on Monday, July 29, 2024

<Aside>
  ¹ The time limit is intended to make this a quick project that can fit most schedules. That being said, if you decide to spend more time on this, we'll never let a silly thing like rules stand in the way of a good time.

  **Didn't this challenge already happen?** You may have noticed that this challenge was previously announced with a different deadline — we're learning as we go here and realized that we didn't do a great job of telling people about this challenge the first time, so we've adjusted our approach and opened it again so more people have the chance to participate!

  The original participants all got some bonus goodies to say thank you, and we carried all original entries forward for this iteration of the giveaway.
