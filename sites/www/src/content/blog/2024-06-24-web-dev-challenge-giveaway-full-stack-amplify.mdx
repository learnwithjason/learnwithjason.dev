## We’re giving away a dream desk setup!

In every episode of [_Web Dev Challenge_](https://lwj.dev/wdc), developers from around the community challenge themselves to build an app that meets a prompt and uses a given tool.

Now you can be one of those devs! **Build your own take on the app prompt and submit it to the showcase** to learn something new, show off your work, have some fun with the web dev community, and learn (or practice) practical skills.

And, as a bonus, **one dev will win a dream desk setup**: [Ugmonk's complete Gather collection](https://ugmonk.com/collections/the-gather-collection/products/the-complete-gather-collection-black-maple?variant=42601772220566).

**Please note:** while anyone can participate, only US residents are eligible to win the desk setup at this time. We're exploring the legal requirements of opening up the giveaway to more countries in future giveaways, but this stuff is _complicated_. Thanks for your understanding.

## The prompt: “build a retro games-themed web app using AWS Amplify”

For this episode, the devs are building a web app for any kind of retro gaming theme they can think of. A Dr. Mario tournament app? Pong leaderboard? Investment advice for Monopoly players? It's all fair game!

[AWS](https://lwj.dev/aws) is sponsoring this episode and giveaway, and the apps must be built using [AWS Amplify](https://lwj.dev/amplify).

## How to enter

If you want to play along, here’s how to enter:

1. Build a web app that has a retro games theme
2. Use [AWS Amplify](https://lwj.dev/amplify) as part of your web app
3. Release the source code as a public GitHub repo
4. Publish the web app to a public URL
5. [Submit your web app](https://forms.gle/y4SqWVXw72q7PHETA) using the form below by 11:59pm on Monday, July 8, 2024

## Play along with friends!

If you're looking for others who are getting involved, we've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) (called `#builder-chat`) for people to brainstorm, share ideas, and keep each other accountable.

We've also got friends from the AWS team available to answer your AWS Amplify questions as you're building.

Happy building! Let's have some fun. <Heart />
