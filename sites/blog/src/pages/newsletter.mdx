## New episodes, tutorials, and career growth for web devs — direct to your inbox each week.

I publish a lot of material — new _Learn With Jason_ episodes, tutorials, career and personal growth lessons, and a lot more — and it shows up on a lot of different sites.

The only place where I share _all of it_ is in my newsletter, which I send out every week (more or less).

<OptInForm disclaimer="And just so we’re clear: I won’t share or sell your information and you can unsubscribe with one click (and no guilt trip) at any time.">

## Subscribe and never miss an update!

I send roughly one email a week with new episodes, tutorials, and anything else I think might help you learn, build, and/or grow in your web dev career.
