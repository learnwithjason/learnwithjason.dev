## How it works

Twice a week, we get a live lesson from an expert and follow along as Jason learns a new technology, skill, concept, or [something completely different](/let-s-learn-minecraft) in 90 minutes or less. We start from scratch whenever possible, so there’s no magic, no assumed knowledge, and no surprises.

_Learn With Jason_ goes beyond pair programming, however, by letting the live audience participate. From chatting and live Q&A, to choosing features and topics to cover, to playing custom sound effects and animations, you help create the show! Make sure to [add _Learn With Jason_ to your Google Calendar](/calendar) and watch live to be an active participant in the episode — the show is so much more fun with friends!
