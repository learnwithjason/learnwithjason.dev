# learnwithjason.dev

This is the website and CMS for [learnwithjason.dev][lwj]. 💜

There are four parts to this site:

1. A [Sanity][sanity] instance that manages the episode and guest information
2. A [Gatsby theme][theme] that handles the heavy lifting of sourcing Sanity data and creating pages in Gatsby
3. A Gatsby site that implements [Theme UI][theme-ui] to style up the site
4. An infinite supply of boops

For more information on building themes, check out my [egghead course][egghead].
