  One More
  <span>Step.</span>

## Welcome to the party!

I’m really excited you’re here. There’s just one more thing left to do:

**Please click the “confirm your email” button in the email I just sent.**

This is a necessary step to make sure that you’re only getting email that you _actually_ want, and to prevent people from trolling their friends by signing them up for surprise emails from me. (I get it: siccing me on unsuspecting strangers is a great troll.)

But that’s not the kind of operation I run here. Only messages you _actually want_ will arrive. 😂

So head over to your inbox, click that confirm button, and I’ll send over the first bit of content right away!
